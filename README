Guile-DSV is a GNU Guile module for working with the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values][delimiter-separated
values]] (DSV) data format.

* Requirements

  - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guile/][GNU Guile]] 2.0.x
  - (srfi srfi-1)
  - (srfi srfi-26)
  - (string transform)

* Distribution

Files:
 - AUTHORS contains list of people who contributed to the library
   development.
 - COPYING contains the terms of GNU General Public License.
 - INSTALL contains general instructions for building/installing of
   Guile-DSV
 - NEWS describes user-visible changes.

Directories:
 - doc      -- Documentation in Texinfo format.
 - tests    -- Unit tests.

Files are usually installed according to the prefix specified to
=configure= script, =/usr/local= by default.  Building and installing
gives you:

Guile modules, in =${GUILE_SITE}/ssh=:
 - dsv.scm

* Installation

For a basic explanation of the installation of the package, see the
INSTALL file.

Please *note* that you will need [[https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/][Automake]] 1.12 or later to run
self-tests with =make check= (but the library itself can be built with
older Automake version such as 1.11).

*important* You probably want to call configure with the
=--with-guilesitedir= option so that this package is installed in
Guile's default path.  But, if you don't know where your Guile site
directory is, run =configure= without the option, and it will give you
a suggestion.
