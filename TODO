* General
** Implement empty rows skipping
   Add a flag for 'dsv->scm' and 'dsv-string->scm' that tells the procedures
   to skip empty rows.
** Add converters between Unix-style DSV and RFC 4180 CSV format and vice versa
* Unix
** Handle nonprintable characters
   as described in
   <http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch05s02.html#id2901882>
* RFC 4180
** Probably commented lines should be handled somehow?
   Currently 'dsv->scm' and 'dsv-string->scm' procedures ignore specified
   'comment-symbol' if the 'format' is set to 'rfc4180.

   To my understanding, the RFC says nothing about comments inside a CSV data,
   but probaby it will be useful if we could somehow skip commented lines.
